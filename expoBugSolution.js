The solution to this problem typically involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection. Try accessing other online resources to verify connectivity.
2. **Clear Package Manager Cache:** Run the following commands for npm or yarn to clear their respective caches:
   * **npm:** `npm cache clean --force`
   * **yarn:** `yarn cache clean`
3. **Try a Different Package Manager:** If you're using npm, try yarn, or vice-versa. This can sometimes resolve conflicts or issues specific to one package manager.
4. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** In extreme cases, reinstalling Expo CLI might be necessary. Follow the official Expo documentation to properly uninstall and reinstall the CLI.
5. **Check for System Errors:** Look for any other system-level errors that might be interfering with the package installation process. This might involve checking for disk space issues or other operating system-related problems.
6. **Examine the Error Message Carefully:** While frequently unhelpful, very closely examine any error messages for any hints about the root cause.  It might mention specific packages or files involved.
7. **Consider Proxy Settings:** If you are behind a corporate proxy, ensure that your proxy settings are correctly configured for npm or yarn.
